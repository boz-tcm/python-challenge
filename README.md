## General Information
- Our project was designed to analyze financial budget records stored in a CSV file. 
- The project solves the problem of efficiently analyzing these records by writing a Python script in Jupyter Notebook that automates the importing of this CSV file and the analysis of the budget records.   
- The Python script produces a Financial Analysis summary showing our total profit over the budget period covered, including average monthly change in profit, and both the greatest monthly increase and drawdown in monthly profit.
- Why did you undertake it?

## Technologies Used
- Python Version 3.10.12
- Jupyter Notebook within Jupyter Lab IDE
- VS Code for README.MD markdown file

## Setup
- GitHub Repository
    - name: 'python-challenge'
    - location: uploaded to Bootcamp homework submission online portal
- Python Standard Library (Version 3.10.11)
- Python Modules:
    - pathlib and Path function
    - csv
- Jupyter Notebook:
    - name: 'main.ipynb'
    - location: 'python-challenge/PyBank/'
- Financial Date File Analyzed:
    - name: 'budget_data.csv'
    - location: 'python-challenge/PyBank/Resources/'

## Usage
The script is run in the Jupyter Notebook 'main.ipynb', within the 'PyBank' directory, using the Notebook environment's 'Run All Cells...' command.

The final printed code output for analysis of the budget_data.csv looks like this: 

`Financial Analysis`

`----------------------------`

`Total Months: 86`

`Total: 38,382,578`

`Average Change: -2,315.12`

`Greatest Increase in Profits:`

`Feb-2012 ($1,926,159)`

`Greatest Decrease in Profits:`

`Sep-2013 ($-2,196,167)`
